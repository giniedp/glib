You can use it for free to test the model formats, how to import, to scale and to setup materials in your rendering application / game engine.

You are allowed to use this material in free or commercial video tutorials or in your technology demonstrations as long as you mention Dexsoft in your product.

You can use it for prototyping or you can add the models to your free or commercial games, images, renderings or videos as long as you mention Dexsoft in your product.

This pack can be distributed as long as this text file keeps part of it and as long as the pack keeps free.
