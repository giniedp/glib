The effects package provides a mechanism to create shaders using shader building blocks.
It also implements various building blocks which can be invoked via the `defaultProgram`
method. The constructed shaders are *feature based* where features are enabled or disabled
by passing a set of glsl `#define` values.

The examples show how common effects can be constructed.
