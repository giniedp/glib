## Pong Game

---

This example implements a well known game Pong
demonstrating some core concepts of the `ecs` package.
The implementation tends to overcomplicate things but that is
simply to show off various methods of how components can interact
with each other.

To play click on the game container so the iframe is focused
then use `W`/`S` keys to control the left paddle and `I`/`K`
keys to control the right paddle.
