# Orientation & Acceleration

The `Orientation` class tracks the device orientation and motion events.
Internally it listens to `deviceorientation` and `devicemotion` events and records
the state.

Visit [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Detecting_device_orientation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Detecting_device_orientation) for more information.

Please open this example in a new windown ([click here](/examples/input/orientation))
because deviceorientation doesn't work in an iframe in all browsers.
