The `@gglib/graphics` package wraps WebGL calls in an object oriented api.
The api itself is still pretty low level.
Exampes in this section demonstrate how common rendering task are solved using only `@gglib/graphics` and `@gglib/math` packages.
Beginning with a simple triangle and then continuing you will learn the following concepts:

* creating vertex and index buffers
* using multiple vertex buffers
* creating textures and render targets
* applying textures to a mesh
* creating shader programs
* using annotations in glsl shaders
* and more
