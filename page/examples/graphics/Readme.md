# Graphics package examples (@gglib/graphics)

---

The graphics package wraps WebGL calls with a more object oriented api.
However the api is still pretty low level.

The exampes in this section demonstrate how the API may be used.
Beginning with a simple triangle and then continuing you will learn the following concepts:

* creating vertex and index buffers
* using multiple vertex buffers
* creating textures and render targets
* applying textures to a mesh
* creating shader programs
* using annotations in glsl shaders
* and more

The examples utilize only the `graphics` and the `math` packages.
No other high level concepts are used.
