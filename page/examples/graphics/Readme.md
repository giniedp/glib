# Graphics package examples

---

The graphics package wraps WebGL calls allowing you to easily setup rendering stages.
Still there are some preparation steps needed before something can be drawn on screen.
These steps are exmplained in the following examples.

Beginning with a simple triangle and then continuing you will learn

* how to setup vertex and index buffers
* using multiple vertex buffers
* creating textures
* applying textures to a mesh
* creating shader programs
* use annotations in glsl shaders
* ... and more

The examples utilize only the `graphics` and the `math` packages. No other high level concepts are
used. Even if there is no direct interaction with WebGL this is still pretty low level.
